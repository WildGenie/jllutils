${Fseablue}Volume is too small ${AC}

${Fseablue}Waiting for network configurationâ€¦${AC}
The eth0 is not linked on startup stage, so system will run /etc/init/failsafe.conf
${Fred}Solved${AC}
Solution-1: remove the unused eth0
Solution-2: change the sleep time in /etc/init/failsafe.conf

Note: wifi is started so slower is because eth0 is bad to delay checking.
Hence please remove the unused eth0
